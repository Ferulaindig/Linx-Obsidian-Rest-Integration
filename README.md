# WORK IN PROGRESS

# Linx-Obsidian-Rest-Integration
Integrating the Linx Designer tool with Obsidan Local Rest API Plugin.

# What Works
## Vault Files

## Vault Directories
Needs cleaned up so that redundant call to root of vault isn't made

## Commands
Just the GET commands call works

## Search
So far just the simple search works

# Potential Issues

I need to go through and check that all the file pattern parameters are consistent. So far as if you'll need to put forward slashes in some variables in file paths and not in other potentially.
